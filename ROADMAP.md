# OSAA MVP Pipeline: Priority Improvements

This document outlines specific, high-priority improvements for the OSAA MVP Data Pipeline project.

## 1. Code Organization

- **Consolidate utility functions**: Move functions from `utils.py` into the new `utils/` package using a logical structure:
  - AWS-related functions → `utils/aws_helpers.py`
  - File handling utilities → `utils/file_helpers.py`
  - Retry mechanisms → `utils/retry.py`

- **Standardize environment variables**: Create a simple, central approach to handle environment variables consistently across the codebase with proper fallbacks and validation.

## 2. Docker Workflow Enhancements

- **Update Dockerfile**: Optimize the Docker image size by using multi-stage builds and reducing installed dependencies to only what's necessary.

- **Improve container security**: Remove any hard-coded credentials and ensure proper volume mounting for sensitive data.

## 3. Pipeline Reliability

- **Add data validation checks**: Implement basic schema validation at key points in the pipeline to catch issues early.

- **Improve error handling**: Standardize error messages and implement graceful failure modes to prevent pipeline interruptions.

## 4. Documentation

- **Container usage guide**: Create a concise guide for using the Docker workflow with clear examples for common tasks.

- **Architecture documentation**: Maintain the data flow diagram to reflect the current implementation.
